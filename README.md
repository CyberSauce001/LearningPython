For helping me improve my python skills and to get me to understand the principle behind python.
Also it help me research and understand my code more instead of just coding and saying this should work, 
without properly understand the intricacy of the function being used. Just having some understanding 
is not enough. Rather having the fundamentals of why it works and how it works, helps me in the long run.

If you are reading this and looking through the comments in my code and see errors or needs to be improve or 
reworded please let me know or you have a better comment that can be explain in simpler terms. So I can learn better.
